# Object-Detection-Using-Deep-Learning

*Here, we will be using a 2D Convolution layer which creates a convolution kernel that is wind with layers input which helps produce a tensor of outputs. The base model is Sequential which is appropriate for a plain stack of layers where each layer has exactly one input tensor and one output tensor.*

The dataset used is of 4 categories of fruits:

1. Apple
2. Banana
3. Mixed
4. Orange

(240 images in train folder. 60 images in test folder.)
